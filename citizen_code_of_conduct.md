We invite all those who participate in COMMUNITY_NAME to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open [ Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [ source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
